# Biography
I go by the handle "Legoclones", which I've had since a tween when I was VERY interested in LEGOs and clone troopers. I'm a cybersecurity student (both at BYU and for life) and love the challenge that cyber presents. I'm initiative-driven, detail-focused, and highly motivated to learn and contribute to the InfoSec community. I'm technical by nature, which is why I've felt naturally drawn to CTFs. 

I'm currently a [SMART Scholar](https://www.smartscholarship.org/smart) for the Department of Defense, and am a member of the [US Cyber Team](https://www.uscybergames.com/) which competes internationally in cyber competitions. I also play CTFs with my school team [BYU Cyberia](https://ctftime.org/team/155711), and the international team [Project Sekai](https://ctftime.org/team/169557). Cyber competitions are my bread and butter, and I love pushing myself to improve.
